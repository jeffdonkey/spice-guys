> MIT license with additional text to prohibit use by fascists

### [READ LICENSE TEXT](./LICENSE)

---

We love Open Source, and we  want to give my software away to as many people as
possible. However, we refuse to let my work benefit those who support fascism.

If you are not a fascist and don't actively support any fascists, you have
absolutely nothing to worry about. We will not pursue any legal claims against
you, even if our license text is poorly written.

If that is not enough for your organization, we can personally grant you an
unmodified MIT license. Please follow these steps:

- Email antifa-license@gmail.com with information about the entity
  requesting an MIT license.
- We will provide you with a dollar amount† which said entity must donate to
  one of the following orgs in order to be granted an MIT license.
  - [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/)
  - [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org)
  - [Human Rights Campaign](http://www.hrc.org)
  - [Refuse Fascism](https://refusefascism.org/)
- Email antifa-license@gmail.com with a receipt of your donation.

> † - dollar amounts may range from $0 (for entities that we like) to $500
> (for smaller businesses and such) to $5,000-$50,000+ (for large/publicly
> traded corporations).
